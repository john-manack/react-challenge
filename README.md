# Timed React Challenge

This react app was built from scratch (no copy/pasting of code) in 3hrs, 45mins. It is deployed here: https://zealous-jackson-b27cb1.netlify.app/

Built with React, using create-react-app.

## What does this app do?

Well, I'm glad you asked. This app is intended for use by web developers who need quick and easy access to stock photos for their projects. The landing page loads a list of 100 high resolution images each time the page refreshes. Once the user finds an image they would like to use, they simply click the image to gain access to 24 different size, color, and effect options for their selection.
